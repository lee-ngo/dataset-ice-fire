# Introduction to Data Science by Lee Ngo 
#### Exploring a Dataset of Ice and Fire

Hello, and welcome to an intentionally fun and light-hearted approach to learning data science for beginners! 
In this course, you will learn the following:
* How to set up your environments like a proper data scientist
* Learn the basics of the Python language for data science
* Import popular Python libraries and data files
* Perform some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Complete some Data Visualization

We will be exploring [this dataset](https://github.com/chrisalbon/war_of_the_five_kings_dataset) created for fun by **Chris Albon** ([github.com/chrisalbon](https://github.com/chrisalbon)) (thank you)! Yes, we're going to have a lot of fun with this one.

## What You Need To Know First

This course is designed for complete beginners, but knowing the following will help tremendously:
* Some basic Python code. I strongly recommend going through the [Codecademy tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) or [Learn Python The Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/).
* An understanding of working in terminals or command prompts, especially navigating folders and files. [Here's an example](http://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands).
* An understanding of how GitHub works, or just knowing how to download a text file to the right location. You might as well download the entire repository, but just in case, [here's all you need for this lesson](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4604663/download-single-files-from-github).

*If you have any suggestions on ways to make this class even more accessible, please suggest them!*

## Setting Up Your Computer

**To begin, we need to install some software on your computer that will run the following:*
* Python (we'll be working with Python 3, but Python 2 should be just fine, too)
* Jupyter Notebooks, a great tool for iterating quickly in Python
* Various Python libraries (we'll be using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib) 

Fortunately, we can do all of the above simply by installing one thing: **Anaconda** from [Continuum Analytics](https://continuum.io)

### Please follow the link below to set up Anaconda on your computer.

We won't be sharing specific steps because it varies per computer.

### Download the GitHub repository for this course
1. Go to the top-right corner and find the "Clone or Download" button. Click on it.
2. Click on `Download ZIP` and save that file somewhere on your computer. 
3. Unzip the file you just downloaded and remember where that directory is.

### Initialize Jupyter Notebooks in your terminal

1. Open up your Command Prompt, Terminal, Git, etc.. 
2. Navigate to the folder/directory where you downloaded this GitHub repository.
3. Type `jupyter notebook` into the command prompt and wait a moment.

If a webpage opens that says 'Jupyter' at the top, you're ready to more forward!

*At this point, you can open up your own Jupyter Notebook or, if you must, use this pre-populated one below.*

*Why are we using Python instead of R or some other language?*
Ah, this old debate. Although others have a stronger opinion than I do on the matter, I've just happened to learn most of my data science via Python and discovered a great community around it. Generally, I code in JavaScript or Python, and anyone will tell you that *it doesn't really matter* what you code in as long as you know how to code. 

If there's enough interest in converting this lesson into R or another langauge, perhaps I'll do it... (but probably not).
